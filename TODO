TODO:

When a candidate is approved as a full node:
→ add to routing table (in handle_candidate_approval) — need low level routing first

Investigate:
→ remove_unapproved_candidates
→ remove_expired_candidates

Low level routing:
→ simple list of connected peers that we can use to forward messages
→ don't send to multiple members of another section; instead send to one who "swarms" the message

When receiving a record entry:
→ if ahead of your log, request update from neighbour
