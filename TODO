TODO:

* means done
# means current solution is ugly

When a candidate is accepted:
→ accumulation and close-group algorithms should exclude candidates*
→ candidate should not send messages from its section
→ all nodes should add it as a candidate*
→ candidate should receive new records*#
→ candidate must be careful what it does with any message
→ candidate should accumulate pending records
→ candidate should remove pending records when they are appended

When a candidate times out, or a replacement candidate is accepted:
→ remove from routing table on timeout OR new candidate

When a candidate is approved as a full node:
→ candidate may now send messages, including pending record entries
→ add to routing table (in handle_candidate_approval)

Investigate:
→ support unknown candidates in the routing table
→ remove_unapproved_candidates
→ remove_expired_candidates
→ why are multiple candidates allowed in route_mgr?
→ why do we keep approved candidates in the list?
